## Usage

To use this crawler, you can invoke it as a `CLI`, talk to it using the `Telegram bot` or import it and use it as an `API`. The API is the highest surface
used to build higher level interfaces from it, for example the `CLI` and the `Telegram bot`.

Head to the interface you want to use and follow the examples.

### API

Import the API and use the `find_awesome_threads` function to find some amazing threads.

```python
from crawler.api import find_awesome_threads
subreddits = ["cats", "askreddit", "brazil"]
awesome_threads = find_awesome_threads(subreddits)
print(awesome_threads)
```

### CLI

```console
$ python cli.py -h
$ python cli.py "cats;askreddit"
```

### Telegram bot
